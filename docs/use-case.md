# Use Case: Eventfully

## Overall

Eventfully is a software to find and explore new events in your area and learn more about culture, technology and more from one website. It combines many different event sites in one and there are many events in your area and in Europe. Plus, you can connect with people and make new friends and have an exprerience you never had before. Eventfully eliminates the hard search for events on the Internet and it has many different events so that everyone can find the event they are looking for.

## Like Feature

The Like feature in Eventfully gives you the opportunity to remember an event if you think it is interesting, just like in social media. This feature is valuable for such a website, because often you don't know if you can go to an event or you just find it interesting, so you can like this event to remember it, so you won't forget the event. Surprisingly, we haven't seen this feature in any other event site we've looked for.

## Group Feature

The Groups feature lets you create your own group and share events in that group. This makes it easier to find the right event for your next get-together, and you don't have to create a group chat in another app and then send links between each member. Now you have all the information about a shared event in one place, and you don't have to switch tabs or do complicated switching between apps. It is also much more organized than a group chat. Plus, it's a feature we haven't seen on any other event site.

## Web Scraping

Web scraping makes it possible to have many different events in one place. Often there are many websites for different regions and you have to search for the right one. With web scraping we overcome this problem by scraping many websites for important information like Where the event takes place or when it is scheduled. This information is displayed to the user on Eventfully. This makes it easier to find your event and makes the overall experience of searching for events better and smoother.

## Newsletter-Scraping

Newsletter scraping gives you exclusive information about events that are otherwise only available by subscribing to those newsletters and receiving constant emails from them. First of all, this is annoying, and not everyone checks their email inbox every day. We solved this problem by subscribing to newsletters for you, and we scrape every incoming email with AI and extract the important information and display it on Eventfully. With this method we make sure that the most events are available to the user by only going to one website, so you can use the features of Eventfully.
