# Use Case: Eventfully
## Overall Use Case
Eventfully is a software to find and explore new events in your area and learn more about culture, technology and more from one website. It combines many different event-sites in one and there are many events in your area and in europe. Additionally, you can connect with people and find new friends and get a exprerience that you never had before. Eventfully eliminates the hard search for events on the internet and it has many different events, so that everybody can find the event they are looking for.

## Like Feature: Use Case
The Like Feature in Eventfully gives you a opportunity, to remember a event when you think that it is interesting, just like on Social Media. This Feature is valueable for such a website, because often you don't know if you can go to a event or you just find it interesting, that you can like this event so that it is remembered so that you will not forget the event. Surprisingly we haven't seen this feature in any other event-website that we searched for.

## Group Feature: Use Case
The Group Feature, let's you create your own group and share events in this group. This makes, finding the right event for your next meet easier and you don't need to make a goup chat in another app and then send links between every member. Now you have all the information about a shared event, in one place and you don't have to switch tabs or do any complicated swiching between apps. It is also much better organised than in a group chat. Additionally, this is also a Feature that we haven't seen on any other event-website.

## Web Scraping: Use Case
The Web-Scraping makes it possible to have many different events in one place. Often there are many websites for different regions and you have to search for the right one. With Webscraping we overcome this problem, by scraping many websites for important information like: Where the event is taking place or when it is scheduled. This information is displayed to the user on Eventfully. This makes the search for your event easier and makes the overall experience, to search for events better and smoother 

## Newsletter-Scraping: Use Case
Newsletter-Scraping gives exclusive information about events to you, that are otherwise only available by subscribing to those Newsletters and getting constant e-mails from the Newsletter. This is firstly annoying and not everybody looks in their e-mail mailbox every day. We solved this problem by subscribing to Newsletters for you, and we scrape every incoming e-mail with AI and the important information is extracted and displayed on Eventfully. With this method we ensure that the most events are available to the user by only going on one website, so that you can use the features from Eventfully.
